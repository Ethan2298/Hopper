# Ergonomic Code

Annotated AST code viewer built on a fork of CodeMirror 6. Parses source files into an AST, chunks them into meaningful units, and renders an interactive annotated tree view with plain-English explanations.

## Pipeline

`raw text → AST (Lezer) → chunked tree → LLM annotation → interactive UI`
